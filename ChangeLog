TODO:
* fix verbose/debug output issue in IO handle regarding sector mode

* find a solution for
  - redefinition of _FILE_OFFSET_BITS for Solaris
  - redefinition of _MIN and _MAX for BorlandC
* library
  - add read error support
  - add run-out support (partial)
  - track data cache
  - cache current sector in IO handle
  - check MSF in track sector data (requires current sector)
  - emulate checksum and ECC data for 2352 byte sectors
* scanner
  - put syntax error in error object
  - use start conditions %s for REM (has impact on parser)
  - different types of ISRC definitions
* parser
  - make sure sector offsets are relative from the start of the media
  - handle success file commands without a track command
  - refactor code into separate functions?
* session
  - handle pregap and postgap
  - add default 1 session if no session data is available ?
* cue file
  - add syntax restrictions
  - add support for single digit values
  - handle reset of track MSF to 00:00:00
* add support for .toc file
* libodraw_track_value_copy_track_data_to_buffer
  - add read error support
  - emulate sector error correction data

Tools:
* odrawinfo
  - add flag to skip open of data files ?
  - add byte size string output (see smdevinfo)
* odrawmount
  - create?
  - mount different sessions

Deployment
* check man pages
* check functions included in configure.ac
* add examples
